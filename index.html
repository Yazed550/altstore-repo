Due API limitations, the new design will **not** be available for iOS 13 and below. That means any feature that depends on the new design will also **not** be back-ported to iOS 13. Launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 14 will show the new design and launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 13 and below will show the old design.\r\n\r\niOS 14 unfortunately patched the ptrace() exploit that allowed UTM to run side-loaded on non-jailbroken devices. However, iOS 14.2 introduces a new method for running UTM's JIT engine (untethered). As of this release, the changes to AltStore required for the new method are not released yet, so for now the recommended way to install UTM for iOS 14.2 is **not** to use AltStore. You should use [iOS App Signer][2] until the new AltStore is released.\r\n\r\nAs always, please report all bugs to [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* (iOS 14) Detect new iOS 14.2 JIT enable method (see above)\r\n* (iOS 14) Disable modifying VM settings when suspended (#476)\r\n* (iOS 14) When VM is suspended, add toolbar/menu option to delete save state. Also show suspended state in details view.\r\n* Fix QEMU issue where on some occasion, \"Could not remap code buffer mirror\" error shows up on launch.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[2]: https://dantheman827.github.io/ios-app-signer/","downloadURL":"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/download/v2.0b7/UTM.ipa","size":204227002}],"news":[]}
