Note that some settings have moved to different categories\r\n* Overhaul of the UTM backend which should improve application stability\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\n* (iOS) **UTM v3.1.x will be the last update to support iOS 11 and iOS 12.** If you are still running those versions, please make sure you report any issues now so they can be fixed by the final release of v3.1.x. After that, iOS 13+ will be required to run future versions of UTM.\r\n* You can now run .utm files stored anywhere. There are a few caveats: First, all newly created VMs will still be created in the default storage (app sandbox). You can move the VM after creation with the new button on the toolbar or by right clicking (or force touch) on the VM entry and selecting \"Move...\" Second, when VM shortcuts are deleted, the underlying data is unaffected, and shortcuts are automatically deleted when they are no longer valid (for example, the .utm was moved). You can re-import the .utm by either double clicking it from Finder, or using \"File -> Import Virtual Machine...\" Finally, Apple VMs do not support persistent shortcuts, which means the shortcut is *always* deleted after UTM quits. This means you must re-import Apple VMs every time UTM is launched.\r\n* Default machine properties will now always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings. For example, if you are booting an aarch64 virt machine, the property `highmem=off` will be appended unless the user specifies `highmem=on` in QEMU settings. Previously, when you select `virt` in VM settings, the machine properties text box will auto populate with `highmem=off`. If the user deletes it, then the VM will not boot because it requires `highmem=off`. Advanced users can still specify `highmem=on` and it will not be overridden.\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.5)\r\n* Fixed latest Linux kernel failing to boot (“EFI stub: Exiting boot services and installing virtual address map...”) (thanks @agraf for the fix) (#2682)\r\n* Fixed freezing during restart of a GL VM (#3746)\r\n* Clarified that clipboard sharing and auto resolution features are the same setting (#3748)\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.4)\r\n* The changes to behaviour of “legacy input” introduced in v3.1.2 is now disabled by default for all existing (x86_64) virtual machines. For new virtual machines, the default is still to disable PS/2 bus when USB is enabled. However, this can be overridden with a new tweak “Force PS/2 Controller” in the QEMU settings. (#3723)\r\n* The computed size for shortcut VMs is properly calculated and saving shorting VM settings works (#3724)\r\n* \"Error: Use -machine help to list supported machines\" shows up when starting a newly created virtualized VM (#3722)\r\n* Updated zh-Hans translation (thanks @js-john)\r\n* (iOS 11-13) Default UEFI boot to off because we do not have any UI to change it\r\n\r\n## Changes (v3.1.3)\r\n* *Hotfix*: An earlier release of v3.1.3 had a bug which prevented newly created VMs from booting, this has now been fixed\r\n* Use QCOW2 format for EFI variables on newly created variables image. This enables suspend state to work on EFI enabled VMs again (unless suspend fails for other unsupported devices). Note: existing VMs should delete the EFI variables drive from VM Settings in order for UTM to recreate it as QCOW2.\r\n* The busy spinner gets suck during startup or shutdown (#3702)\r\n* Boots Windows ARM emulation with QEMU TCG by adding `virtualization=on` machine property (#3703)\r\n* Default machine properties will always be included *unless* explicitly set to another value in QEMU settings.

No longer deletes these shortcuts by default (#3686)\r\n* Support importing multiple .utm at once (#3685)\r\n* Rename \"import\" menu to \"open\" to reflect the new behaviour of creating a shortcut by default. Add the \"open\" option to the first page of the wizard as well so iOS users can access it\r\n* New context menu option \"New from template...\" can be called to duplicate the settings of an existing QEMU VM without the data (#2339)\r\n* Fixed a UI issue where an error message makes the VM stuck in \"busy\" state\r\n* Disable PS/2 keyboard/mouse when \"legacy input\" is off. Renamed \"legacy input\" to USB mode to make more explicit that when it is off, a USB bus is emulated with the input controls there (#3674)\r\n* Moved USB sharing options to Input tab to consolidate USB settings\r\n* (iOS) Fixed launching on < iOS 15 (except with taurine, which is still broken for different reasons)\r\n* (iOS) Fix saving last display origin and scale (#3669)\r\n* Option to use UTC vs localtime (previous default) in a new option (QEMU -> Tweaks).
