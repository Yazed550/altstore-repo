Due API limitations, the new design will **not** be available for iOS 13 and below. That means any feature that depends on the new design will also **not** be back-ported to iOS 13. Launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 14 will show the new design and launching UTM 2.0 on iOS 13 and below will show the old design.\r\n\r\niOS 14 unfortunately patched the ptrace() exploit that allowed UTM to run side-loaded on non-jailbroken devices. UTM 2.0 running on iOS 14 **requires** either jailbreaking *or* tethering to the Xcode debugger (launch directly from Xcode). To better support future iOS releases, we are deprecating support for non-jailbroken devices. This means that future features may depend on jailbreak and \"legacy\" UTM will no longer get priority for new features.\r\n\r\nAs always, please report all bugs to [Github](https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues)\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n* (iOS 14) Fix import drive permission error\r\n* (iOS 11-12) Fix launching on older versions without SwiftUI.framework\r\n* Updated Zh-Hans translation (thanks @Ty-programmer)\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues","downloadURL":"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/download/v2.0b5/UTM.ipa","size":204224017}],"news":[]}
