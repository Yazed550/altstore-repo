This is the Documents folder in UTM's sandbox, **not** the user's documents directory.\r\n* Disabled sharing options and show warning message when console mode is enabled\r\n* No more white background behind the console (#1201)\r\n* (macOS) Enhanced UI for setting CPU flags\r\n* (macOS) Detect when SPICE agent is installed and allow resolution change by resizing the VM window\r\n* (macOS) New settings option to right click with Control+click (#2287)\r\n\r\n## Notice for iOS 14.4\r\n\r\niOS 14.4 broke JIT again (for non-jailbroken A12+ devices), and likely for good this time. We do not recommend updating to iOS 14.4. Future support for iOS will be limited to jailbroken devices only.\r\n\r\n## macOS Sandbox Migration\r\nIf you are updating from < 2.0.17 on macOS, then when you open UTM you will not see any VMs you previously created! To fix this, move your .utm files from `~/Documents` to `~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents`. You can do it in Terminal with the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmv ~/Documents/*.utm ~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents\r\n```\r\n\r\nor with Finder\r\n\r\n1. Open Finder and go to your home directory.\r\n2. Press Cmd+Shift+. (that's the period key) to show hidden files.\r\n3. Browse to Library -> Containers -> UTM -> Data -> Documents\r\n4. Copy or move your .utm files from your home's Documents directory to this directory.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* Black screen or crash trying to start any VM? Make sure you read **all** the instructions in the [install page][1].\r\n* Cannot import any drives/ISO: there is a bug in iOS where an invalid \"application-identifier\" entitlement causes the file picker to not work. A fix for iOS App Signer is [submitted][3] and can be manually compiled. If you are using AltStore, you need use a free (not paid) developer account.\r\n* When installed via Cydia/Sileo, Settings and Files integration does not work and VMs are not deleted automatically when uninstalled.\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[3]: https://github.com/DanTheMan827/ios-app-signer/pull/163\r\n[4]: https://getutm.app/install/#jailbroken-devices","downloadURL":"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/download/v2.0.20/UTM.ipa","size":189767236}],"news":[]}
