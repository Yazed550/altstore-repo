Warn user if mouse is not captured. (#2321)\r\n* Removed legacy boot device order settings and added a note about how boot ordering is determined by order of drives added (which can be moved around). This should fix some boot issues (provided you move the devices in the right order).\r\n* Fixed non-removable CD/DVD devices not being recognized/not being able to boot (#2419)\r\n* Fixed notes cut off on iOS (#2460)\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][2] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues","downloadURL":"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/download/v2.0.27/UTM.ipa","size":189235736}],"news":[]}
