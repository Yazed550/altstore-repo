Should prevent \"file already exists\" error when importing a disk image. (#2275)\r\n* (Both) Default x86_64 and i386 target is now q35 (2009) (#2274)\r\n* (Both) Export QEMU command line feature (#2283)\r\n* (Both) New setting: change CPU model and CPU flags when supported by QEMU (#1197)\r\n\r\n## Notice for upcoming iOS update\r\n\r\niOS 14.4 beta 2 broke JIT again (for non-jailbroken A12+ devices), and likely for good this time. We do not recommend updating to iOS 14.4 when it is released to the public.\r\n\r\n## macOS Sandbox Migration\r\nIf you are updating from < 2.0.17 on macOS, then when you open UTM you will not see any VMs you previously created! To fix this, move your .utm files from `~/Documents` to `~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents`. You can do it in Terminal with the following command:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmv ~/Documents/*.utm ~/Library/Containers/com.utmapp.UTM/Data/Documents\r\n```\r\n\r\nor with Finder\r\n\r\n1. Open Finder and go to your home directory.\r\n2. Press Cmd+Shift+. (that's the period key) to show hidden files.\r\n3. Browse to Library -> Containers -> UTM -> Data -> Documents\r\n4. Copy or move your .utm files from your home's Documents directory to this directory.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n* Black screen or crash trying to start any VM? Make sure you read **all** the instructions in the [install page][1].\r\n* Cannot import any drives/ISO: there is a bug in iOS where an invalid \"application-identifier\" entitlement causes the file picker to not work. A fix for iOS App Signer is [submitted][3] and can be manually compiled. If you are using AltStore, you need use a free (not paid) developer account.\r\n* When installed via Cydia/Sileo, Settings and Files integration does not work and VMs are not deleted automatically when uninstalled.\r\n\r\nPlease check the full list on [Github][1] and help report any bug you find that is not listed.\r\n\r\n[1]: https://getutm.app/install/\r\n[2]: https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/issues\r\n[3]: https://github.com/DanTheMan827/ios-app-signer/pull/163\r\n[4]: https://getutm.app/install/#jailbroken-devices","downloadURL":"https://github.com/utmapp/UTM/releases/download/v2.0.19/UTM.ipa","size":189797067}],"news":[]}
